    Although C1/C2/C3/C4 is supported with CPU PWR MGMT, that is not
    meaning all of these Cx is suitable with tickless. For example,
    if we config C4(CPU of STM32L496G enter standby mode which is
    defined in reference maunal, the standby mode is something similar
    power off the board) with tickless mode, when system has nothing
    to do and decide enter tickless mode with one second
    (such as the shortest sleep time of task) sleep time with C4,
    the RTC is programmed to fire interrupt at one second, and then
    CPU goto C4, and CPU goto standby mode which is something similar
    power off the board, and with one second passed, the RTC fired
    interrupt to wake up CPU, the CPU will start with first instruction
    not the WFI, this lead system reboot in one second and find it
    could goto C4 again and reboot in one second again and again.

    With tickless mode, there is no need for user to decide when and
    which Cx state is selected to enter tickless mode, the tickless
    module will decide itself, C1/C2/C3 is suitable for tickless here.

    But for C4-standby mode(not all standby mode of all SOC has same
    meaning) here, it's better for user to decide when to put CPU
    into C4 state, and it's responsibility of user to prepare/programm
    the wakeup source before CPU enter C4 mode, normally the wakeup
    source could be RTC, sensor and anything, please reference your
    SOC user manual to check the detail which resource would be used.

    The RTC here for C4 is for example showing how to wakeup CPU in
    C4, you could open it for testing.
